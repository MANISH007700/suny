# 🆘 Manual Escalation Feature - User Guide

## How It Works

### For Students

#### Step 1: Ask Your Question
1. Type your question in the chat
2. Click "📤 Send"
3. Review the AI's response

#### Step 2: Decide If You Need Human Help

**4. How urgent is this? (slider)**

- 🎯 Priority level indicator
- 💬 Message that advisor will contact you soon

## When to Use Manual Escalation

### Good Reasons to Escalate:

✅ **AI answer was incomplete**
- "The AI gave me general info, but I need specifics for my situation"

✅ **Need personalized advice**
- "I want to discuss my course load and career goals"

✅ **Complex decision**
- "I need help deciding between two majors"

✅ **Urgent matter**
- "Deadline is tomorrow, need immediate help"

✅ **Sensitive topic**
- "Financial situation, personal circumstances"

✅ **Policy clarification**
- "Need official confirmation from an advisor"

### When NOT to Escalate:

❌ AI already gave you a complete, helpful answer
❌ Question is simple and already answered in documents
❌ Just testing the system
❌ Information is readily available on website

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Student needs help with course selection

1. **Student asks**: "What are the prerequisites for CS 301?"

2. **AI responds**: "Based on the documents, CS 301 requires CS 201 and MATH 142"

3. **Student realizes**: "I took equivalent courses at another school"

4. **Student clicks**: "🆘 Escalate to Advisor"

5. **Student fills form**:
   - Question: "What are the prerequisites for CS 301? I have transfer credits."
   - Reason: "Course registration or prerequisite issue"
   - Urgency: ⭐⭐⭐ Medium
   - Notes: "I took Data Structures and Calc II at Community College. Need to know if they count."
   - Priority: 3

6. **System confirms**: "✅ Escalation submitted! ID: abc12345... An advisor will review soon."

7. **Advisor sees**: Full context including transfer credit concern, can provide proper guidance

## Automatic vs Manual Escalation

### Automatic Escalation
- System detects sensitive keywords (financial aid, failing, etc.)
- AI expresses uncertainty or lack of information
- Happens WITHOUT student action
- Creates escalation automatically

### Manual Escalation (NEW!)
- **Student initiates** by clicking button
- Student fills out detailed form
- Student controls priority and reason
- Student adds specific context

### Both Types:
- Go to same advisor dashboard
- Handled by advisors the same way
- Include full conversation history
- Track student profile and risk

## Benefits

### For Students:
✅ **Control**: You decide when you need human help
✅ **Context**: You can add important details
✅ **Priority**: You can mark urgent issues
✅ **Tracking**: Get an escalation ID for reference

### For Advisors:
✅ **Better context**: See why student needs help
✅ **Proper prioritization**: Student-indicated urgency
✅ **Detailed information**: Additional notes from student
✅ **Complete history**: Full conversation included

## Tips for Students

1. **Be specific in additional notes**
   - ❌ "Need help"
   - ✅ "Need help by Friday for registration appointment"

2. **Choose appropriate urgency**
   - Don't mark everything as Critical
   - Save ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for true emergencies

3. **Select accurate reason**
   - Helps route to right advisor
   - Faster response time

4. **Include relevant details**
   - Course codes
   - Deadlines
   - Previous actions taken

5. **Keep your escalation ID**
   - Write down or screenshot the ID
   - Use it to follow up if needed
